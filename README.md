# WebLearn
WebLearn is a responsive distance learning website developed for the [Springfield Adult Learning Center](http://www.stcc.edu/adulteducationcenter/) (SALC). This design utilizes a versatile mobile-first design with PHP, HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, SASS, Grunt, and Bootstrap. Encapsulated in WebLearn are two academic learning labs. ABE Lab is designed for students pursuing High School Equivalency Test preparation classes. ESOL Lab is a resource to help recent immigrants at SALC learn English.

## Installation
It will be useful to set up a test server on your localhost to preview changes before you make them live on the web server. I usually use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) for this purpose. However, whichever environment you choose should run the Apache web server and a stable version of PHP.

Make sure you've installed the following prerequisites your server before we begin:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [GIT](https://git-scm.com/)
