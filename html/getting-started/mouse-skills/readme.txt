USING THIS TUTORIAL

This tutorial may be used for any educational, non-commercial purpose, and it may be installed on your own web server, either "as is" or modified for your own needs. Please inform the Technology Committee of revisions by emailing us at webmaster@tln.lib.mi.us 

To use these files, always open the index.htm file as the start of the New User Tutorial.  


The initial part of the tutorial has been designed to fit within a screen resolution of at least 800x600 so that the students will not need to use a scroll bar, but depending on the number and location of toolbars on your browsers, the content may or may not fit within the windows.  We suggest you view all pages in the browser the students will use to make sure they will not have to use a scroll bar until they get to the section where scroll bars are introduced.

The text size on these pages is flexible, so it can be increased through your browser's text-size settings for students with vision difficulties. Be aware that if text size is increased beyond the medium (default) size, those pages at the beginning of the tutorial where students do not normally use scroll bars may not fit within your browser window, making scroll bars necessary.

As this tutorial uses javascript heavily, it will not work in a browser which has javascript disabled.
